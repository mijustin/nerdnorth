Currently, I'm focused on building and growing [Transistor.fm](https://transistor.fm/?via=justin) with Jon Buda. Transistor is a podcast hosting and analytics platform. Podcasters use us to host their audio, view analytics, and to distribute their shows to Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Google Podcasts.

Jon Buda and I met in Portland, at the XOXO Festival, in 2014. We were both into podcasting: Jon had built an early podcast hosting tool, and I had a podcast. We ended up hanging out quite a bit that week. In the following years, we met up numerous times and even built a few small projects together.

Fast forward to 2017. Jon was working for Cards Against Humanity. They were about to launch a new podcast, and he was building a tool on the side (called Transistor) for them to use. We started talking about the idea of us teaming up and launching it to the public together.

We signed the partnership documents in February of 2018. That month we also made our first bit of revenue: $33.

Jon kept his full-time job and worked nights and weekends. I switched most of my focus to Transistor: doing marketing, inviting beta users, writing docs, and doing customer support.

Since then, we grew Transistor to be a profitable SaaS. I went full-time with Transistor in April 2019, and Jon followed in July 2019.

Today, we serve 4,000 podcasts of all types. Our customers include indie podcasters, small businesses, and enterprise companies. This includes customers like Basecamp, VH1, ProfitWell, Ionic, and Laravel.
