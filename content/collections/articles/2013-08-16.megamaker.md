I’ve been running [MegaMaker](https://megamaker.co) since 2013. It's an online community for bootstrappers. Every day, hundreds of members use it to connect in our forums and Slack chat.

I was motivated to create it because I noticed indie web creators (like me) had similar struggles: isolation, motivation, getting good feedback, and making better things.

Today, we have nearly 600 members worldwide.

We came together because we realized that in order to build something we need to quit thinking about it, and actually do it. We realized we can’t do this in isolation. We need help from other product people.

> “Thank you, Justin, for bringing us together in this group! I’m in several communities and this by far is the most encouraging and positive. People here share their successes and obstacles, which helps me to relate and know that I’m not alone. It’s motivating me to keep going!” – Val Sopi
