I’ve been running [MegaMaker](https://megamaker.co) since 2013. It's an online community for bootstrappers. Every day, hundreds of members use it to connect in our forums and Slack chat.

I was motivated to create it because I noticed indie web creators (like me) had similar struggles: isolation, motivation, getting good feedback, and making better things.

Today, we have nearly 600 members worldwide.
